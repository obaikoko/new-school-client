            Beryl International School’s core values—excellence, integrity,
            respect, and community—form the foundation of its educational
            philosophy. These values are evident in every aspect of the school,

          <p className='text-lg mb-6'>
            The birth of Beryl International Schools, Ikot-Eneobong Federal
            Housing Estate is a supernatural one. God&apos;s grace and mercy
            brought us here, and the same will sustain us and every activity
            embarked upon. This journey started on the 12th day of September,
            2016 when the school resumed for its first session’s academic
            activities with four pupils and four staff in three classrooms and
            three offices as a springboard. To God&apos;s glory, today, Beryl
            International Schools has gotten all the approvals needed for its
            full and optimal operation and functionalities from Primary to
            Secondary levels, even as we expect to go higher in our quest for
            excellence and global recognition. In Beryl International Schools,
            we believe that learning is fun, and we keep fit to learn. This
            belief has powered our numerous activities such as: sport time every
            Friday, debates, quiz, mathematics competitions, excursions, arts
            exhibitions, music and choreography, cultural displays among others.
            These activities have not only created room for fun but have
            triggered the creative and innovative skills in the children which
            in no doubt will make them excel in all walks of life. In our quest
            to develop and train children who will stand out in today&apos;s
            world of technology, we combine virtual learning with classroom
            instructions. This also helped us to curb the challenges posed by
            the 2020 Covid-19 academic lockdown. Beryl International Schools has
            over the years grown to having many classrooms, a standard play
            court, Physics, Chemistry, Agriculture, Computer, Home Economics
            laboratories, Music and Creative Arts studios, and a school farm to
            ensure compliance to standards. Our Créche is a place every parent
            will love for their babies with an array of qualified, dedicated,
            experienced, and God-fearing teachers.
